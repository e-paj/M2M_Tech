- 👋 Hi, I’m @e-paj or Esnobi Pajanconi.

- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. If we're talking about music, then K-pop is my go to. If we're talking about hobbies, then painting and watching series are some that I like to do.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do data analysis in Python. Most of my experience came from using R. Hence, I am taking this time to learn Python. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of projects. Be it a small one like the project I'm currently doing, *Machine Learning Projects*, or a big one. It does not matter!! I'm looking forward to being part of a project I've never done before.
